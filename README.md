Description project: Simulation of car service workflow.  
The application uses all OOP paradigms and technologies such as: 
  * pattern programming (in particular, Singleton);
  * multithreading (wait/notify);
  * input/output to the console and files;
  * calculation of random variables;
  * collections (in particular, queues and lists).
  
In addition, there is a conclusion full of information, statistics and quality recommendations. Also, my term paper on this topic is attached to the repository (but in Ukrainian).   
     
Below is an application class diagram:
